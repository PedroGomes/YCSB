Yahoo! Cloud System Benchmark (YCSB)
====================================

Personal changes:
    A better Cassandra client with more options for the row and column buffers and token based scans (CassandraClient8 - don't look to the version, this works with 1.0+).
    A new workload for reading a file based workloads with more result storage
    A small client for direct reads from the file system (a small experience still in its early steps)

Getting Started (From the original)
---------------

1. Download the latest release of YCSB:

    wget https://github.com/downloads/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/ycsb-0.1.4.tar.gz
    tar xfvz ycsb-0.1.4
    cd ycsb-0.1.4

2. Set up a database to benchmark. There is a README file under each binding
   directory.

3. Run YCSB command. 

    bin/ycsb load basic -P workloads/workloada
    bin/ycsb run basic -P workloads/workloada

   Running the `ycsb` command without any argument will print the usage. 
   
   See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload
   for a detailed documentation on how to run a workload.

   See https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Properties for 
   the list of available workload properties.

4. For this mod, usually you would use 
./ycsb run cassandra-8 -P ../file_workloads/workload_1 -P ../properties/cassandra.config


Notes:
To compile with maven some databases where disabled.
