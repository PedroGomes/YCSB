Yahoo! Cloud System Benchmark (YCSB)
====================================

Personal changes:
    A better Cassandra client with more options for the row and column buffers and token based scans.
    A new workload for reading a file based workloads with more result storage
    Integration also for the measurement of errors (beta)
    A small client for direct reads from the file system (a small experience still in its early steps)
